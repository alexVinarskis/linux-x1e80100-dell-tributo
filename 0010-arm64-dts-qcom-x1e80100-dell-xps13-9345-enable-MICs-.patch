Subject: [PATCH 1/5] arm64: dts: qcom: x1e80100-dell-xps13-9345: enable MICs
 LDO

Particular device comes without headset combo jack, hence does not
feature wcd codec IC. In such cases, DMICs are powered from vreg_l1b.
Describe both microphones in the audio routing. vdd-micb is defined
for lpass-macro already.
